# Data Analysis for Electrochemistry

This repository contains scripts for analyzing electrochemical data, specifically for **cyclic voltammetry (CV)** applications. These scripts were developed as part of my Masterâ€™s Thesis in Analytical Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. You can access the full thesis [here](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/46030/).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of these scripts is to demonstrate data analysis techniques for optimizing CV signals and understanding the effects of different parameters on electrochemical reactions.
